# function_approx
First two projects are from my University class Numerical Methods.

First one is about working with
matrices - checking what effect number of elements or magnitude of elements have on the accuracy of the operations done on the matrices.
Also I've developed a procedure for solving linear systems of algebraic equations with the method "Choleski-Banachiewicz distribution"

Second project consists function approximation using least squares method and an error of this approximation.
Both projects display diagrams of calculated errors for specific operations done throughout the code.
